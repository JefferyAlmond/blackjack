Android blackjack app

Blackjack program to test basic Android functionality, XML, image display, and file retrieval. 

Five card charlie beats any score. Ties go to dealer. Dealer always hits on a score of less than 17. Player can double down on score of 9, 10, or 11 to take 1 more card and double bet. Shoe mode allows for repeat cards.

Blackjack has many rule variations and some are easier to implement than others. I would rather talk to an expert on blackjack before deciding what to include and not include, but this game is functional and bug-free as far as I can determine.

Does not include strings or image files.
